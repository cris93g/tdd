<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*Must create a simple application that shows salex tax;
*sales tax is .10
*imported tax is 0.05
*items must be all added and show something like a receipt
*should implement test
*code should be clean
*
*
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*gonna start out with the bones so probably thinking about a interface.
*interface will extends to an abstract class that contains the main logic of building the items
*do have constants so will probably have enums
*gonna make a class from the abstract that can easly be read
*and will need the final logic about taxes and addition
*
*
*
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
*started writing dummy test
*completed first interface
*completed abstract class
*completed enums
*completed items class
*completed transactions
*imputs and outputs are correct
*
<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
*I still need to refactor the test a little better aswell as the code so its more readable.
*the transaction list should take in array of items instead of doing one by one
*
